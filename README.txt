Simple projects that I have done to develop my learning

I focused on learning Python and I found myself in bioinformatics.
Initially, some projects were just to test my knowledge of Python, but I have done and will continue to do projects directly related to bioinformatics.

I decided to put them in a repository on github to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience with colleagues

Any questions or comments please contact me
Yours sincerely
